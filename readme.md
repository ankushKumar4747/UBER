## /users/profile

### Description
This endpoint retrieves the authenticated user's profile. The request must include a valid authentication tokenâ€”either as a "Bearer" token in the `Authorization` header or as a cookie. The authentication is handled by the middleware in [`authUser`](Backend/middleware/auth.middleware.js), which verifies the token and populates `req.user`.

### Endpoint
`GET /users/profile`

### Headers
- **Authorization**: Bearer token (or include the token as a cookie)

### Response
On success, the endpoint returns a JSON object containing the user's profile data. An example response is as follows:

```json
{
  "_id": "60d0fe4f5311236168a109ca",
  "fullname": {
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe"
  },
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

```

## /users/logout

### Description
This endpoint is used to log out a user. It invalidates the user's authentication token by adding it to a blacklist and clearing the token cookie.

### Endpoint
`GET /users/logout`

### Headers
- **Authorization**: Bearer token (or include the token as a cookie)

### Response
On success, the endpoint returns a JSON object confirming the logout success. An example response is as follows:
